            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Oraſmuch as it is not vnknowen,</hi> That in former times when all or the greateſt part of Pepper, and other Spices of the grouth of the <hi>Eaſt Indies,</hi> was brought into this our Realme of England and Principalitie of Wales by Strangers onely, the ſame was then ſold at very high Rates, vntill ſuch time as ſome of our owne Merchants did themſelues trade into thoſe parts, and bringing in good quantities of thoſe Commodities, did ſell the ſame at much lower prices, to the great reliefe and benefit of all our Subiects in generall: And foraſmuch as we doe finde, That the eſtabliſhment and continuance of this Trade, hath and will be more and more an occaſion to imploy and encreaſe the great Shipping of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, which hath heretofore bene out of vſe, as being not ſo neceſſary for Trade in Countreys that are not ſo farre remote: For theſe, and ſome other reaſons which haue bene deliuered vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs, being deſirous to encourage this Company, and to maintaine that Trade by all good and lawfull meanes; And experience teaching vs, That if there ſhould be, till the Trade were better ſetled, a free and generall libertie for all perſons whatſoeuer to bring in thoſe Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, it would be an occaſion to ouerlay the Trade, and Strangers would of purpoſe vent their Spices at ſmall Rates, thereby to enforce our owne Subiects to deſiſt from trading into thoſe Countreis: Wee with the aduiſe of our Priuie Councell, haue thought fit, for ſome time to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraine the Importation of Pepper from forraine parts, by any others then by the Merchants ioyntly of the <hi>Eaſt Indian</hi> Company. And therefore wee doe hereby will and commaund all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and perſons whatſoeuer, either our naturall borne Subiects, Denizens, or Strangers (not being the Company aforeſaid) to forbeare to bring into theſe our Dominions of England and Wales, any Pepper, directly or indirectly, vpon paine of forfeiture of the goods, and what other puniſhment they may incurre by any contempt and default herein. And to the end, this our pleaſure may be more duely obſerued, Wee doe likewiſe charge and command all Cuſtomers, Comptrollers, Searchers, Waiters, Farmours of our Cuſtomes and their Deputies, and all other our Officers of the Ports, within our Territories aforeſaid, That they doe not giue any Bills of Entrie for Pepper that is brought in from forraine Countreis, by any other then thoſe who ſhall be knowen to bee of the Company aforeſaid: Neither ſhall they ſuffer it to bee landed, or being ſo, ſhall ſeize the ſame to our vſe as iuſtly forfaited. And moreouer, they and euery of them, ſhall vſe their beſt meanes and endeuours to hinder and preuent all ſecret and fraudulent practizes of ſuch as ſhall ſeeke to bring it that Commoditie, Notwithſtanding this our pleaſure publiſhed to the contrary.</p>

            <pb facs="tcp:173540:3"/>
            <p>ANd becauſe we are careful to preuent al inconueniences to the generality of our Subiects, in caſe they ſhould be hardly dealt with vnder this reſtraint, by thoſe that haue the whole maſſe of Pepper in their owne hands; Although wee hold the Company to be compounded of many good and honeſt Merchants and others, yet becauſe there is no Societie wherein all are of one temper, And out of the care we haue alwayes had for the common good of all our people more then of any particuler Societie; wee thought it not ſafe to repoſe ſo much confidence in a part of our people, as to leaue the whole Body ſubiect to their wills, in matter of this nature.</p>
            <p>And therefore hauing well examined what might be an indifferent price to yeeld to the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants competent gaine for the maintenance of ſo great and long a Trade, and ſo needfull for the ſupport of Nauigation, and yet not be ouerchargeable to the reſt of our people, who haue on the other ſide dayly vſe of that kinde of Spice; We haue conditioned with them, and limitted, That they ſhall vtter Pepper at the rate of Two ſhillings ſixe pence the pound, and not exceed, to any that ſhall come or ſend for it, vpon paine of our high diſpleaſure.</p>
            <p>Which prouiſion, and limitation being made by vs in fauour of the communitie of our Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects, we haue thought good to publiſh and make knowen to all men, To the end that if it fall out, that ſuch as by way of Retaile doe vtter to our people dwelling in places remote from our Citie of London, and other parts where Shipping doeth ariue, that kinde of Spice, there bee exacted any prices exceſſiue, it may appeare that the ſame is not for want of due prouiſion made to preuent it, but by the ouergreedineſſe of thoſe which ſhall ſell it. In which conſideration, although wee know, that there are many reaſons, why thoſe that ſell by Retaile, ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund a further price then they pay for it here, as well in reſpect of the diſtance of place, forbea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of their money, as many other things incident to that kinde of Trade: Yet the better to containe them within the bounds of reaſonable gaine, we haue thought good to make knowen thus much, thereby to expreſſe our owne care of our louing Subiects, and to ſhew them the meanes whereby they may auoyd ſuch further burden, as may bee caſt vpon them by any that ſhall goe about by any vndue practiſe, to raiſe immoderate gaine, vnder colour or pretext of that courſe which we haue taken for the reaſons aforeſaid.</p>
